Google Script Auto Save Google Sheet To Excel After sen Email

A classmate of my research institute, asked me (I want to make a form on Google, but I need to use it on Excel every day... Trouble...)
-Use a little time to write it, a small Google script automation program-Google sheet automatic spreadsheet Convert to Excel, 
and then automatically send it to yourself or others. It can be executed. 
This can save a lot of time.
